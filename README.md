# ðŸš€ RAG-Best-Practices

A comprehensive study and implementation of best practices for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems. This project includes advanced features like **model caching**, **multilingual support**, and **evaluation metrics** to enhance the performance and usability of RAG systems.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Advanced Retrieval Options**:
  - **FAISS**: High-performance vector search for fast and accurate document retrieval.
  - **LangChain**: Intelligent search with seamless integration of language models.
  - **HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)**: Generate hypothetical documents to improve retrieval relevance.

- **Model Caching**: Efficient caching of embedding and language models to reduce load times and improve performance.

- **Multilingual Support**: Built-in support for multilingual embeddings, enabling cross-lingual document retrieval.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation tools to measure retrieval accuracy and generation quality.

- **Customizable Configuration**: Easily adjust chunk sizes, overlap, and retrieval parameters to suit your needs.

- **Table Augmented Generation (TAG)**: Involves generating textual outputs based on structured table data. TAG systems analyze tables (e.g., CSV, Excel) and use this structured information to produce contextually relevant text outputs. These systems are useful in scenarios such as data-to-text generation for business intelligence reports or dynamic documentation based on tabular data.
